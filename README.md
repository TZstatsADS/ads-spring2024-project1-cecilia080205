### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: What makes single women and single men happy?
+ This project is conducted by Lei Bao

+ Project summary: In this project, I delved into the textual subtleties of happiness as expressed by single males and females, by analyzing their self-reported happy moments. I employed text mining to identify and compare word usage frequencies, aiming to unearth the unique and common lexical markers of joy in each gender. The findings, visualized through a correlation scatterplot, offer a window into the distinct and shared elements of happiness between single males and females, potentially informing various applications from mental health to marketing strategies.
